# GitWho README

GitWho is a VS Code extension that helps you track and highlight the changes made by specific authors in your project. Using the power of git blame, GitWho allows you to select an author and highlights their changes in the code. It also shows those changes in the minimap, making it easier to track contributions throughout your codebase.

## Features

Author Selection: Quickly select an author from a list of contributors to highlight their changes.

Git Blame Integration: Highlights lines modified by the selected author using git blame.

Minimap Highlights: Highlights the author's changes in the VS Code minimap for easy tracking.

Randomized Color Highlights: Changes are highlighted with pastel colors that change every time you select a new author.

Sidebar Integration: Displays a custom sidebar view like GitLens, giving you a more intuitive overview of author contributions.



## Requirements

Prerequisites
1) VS Code: Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed.

2) Git: The extension requires Git to be installed in your system, as it uses git blame to fetch commit information.

## Extension Settings

1) Open the VS Code Marketplace.

2) Search for GitWho and install the extension.

Alternatively, you can install the extension locally by opening the VS Code command palette and running the following command:

    ext install <your-publisher-name>.<extension-name>
